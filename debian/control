Description: command line tool for Amazon Elastic Container Service
 The Amazon ECS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a command line tool
 for Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) that provides
 high-level commands to simplify creating, updating, and monitoring
 clusters and tasks from a local development environment. The Amazon
 ECS CLI supports Docker Compose, a popular open-source tool for
 defining and running multi-container applications. Use the CLI as
 part of your everyday development and testing cycle as an alternative
 to the AWS Management Console or the AWS CLI.
